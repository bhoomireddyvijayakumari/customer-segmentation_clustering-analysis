# customer-segmentation_clustering-analysis
This customer segmentation project successfully applied KMeans clustering to a clean dataset of customers. Through feature scaling, Elbow and Silhouette methods, and visualizations, the analysis revealed five distinct customer groups. These clusters vary in age, income, and spending patterns, providing meaningful insights for targeted marketing, product planning, and resource allocation. Strategic actions like focusing on premium customers and engaging low spenders were derived based on behavioral traits of each cluster, aiding data-driven business decisions.
